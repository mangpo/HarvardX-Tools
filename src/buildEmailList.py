Builds a csv file of First Name, Last Name, email address for a course

This file needs to be run from a directory in which the users.csv and profiles.csv files
exist. When run, it produces a mailAddresses.csv file with the above format. It will only
include entries for students that are in the user.csv file. If there is a student in the
users.csv file but not in the profiles.csv file, the student's name will read "Missing
 Profile"
