This program will construct a table of when the students of a course registered,
and will track the self-reported gender of those students. The result is a csv
file that contains the date of enrollment, the number of self-reported males,
the number of self-reported females, and the number who did not report, along
with the total number that registered on that day. A final entry will give
totals for the three possible gender choices (M, F, no report) and the total for
the course.

Usage:
    getenrollmentdata.py file1 file2 file3
    
    where: 
    file1 is a csv representation of the student demographic information (user_profile),
    file2 is a csv representation of the course enrollment date (courseenrollent)
    file3 is a csv file that will be written with the enrollment information by day
