'''
Object definition and utility funcitons for the course student state data dumps

Contains a definition of a coursestudentstate object, which contains all of the 
information exported in the coursestudentstate files from edx. Also contains a
function allowing the construction of a dictionary, indexed by the student id,
that maps to this state. As usual, there is also a function that will scrub the
file of entries that are the wrong size.
