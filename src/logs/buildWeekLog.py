'''
Combine all of the log files in a directory into a single log file

This script assumes that all of the log files to be combined are in a 
single directory, and that the name of the directory is the name of the 
class. The program will combine all of the files into a single file, with
the lines in timestamp order. While unlikely, it is possible that multiple
lines have the same timestamp; if that happens they will be ordered in the
order they are seen when read.

The main use for this script is to combine all of the files for a given
week (as obtained from edX) into a file for that week. However, if multiple
weeks log files are in the directory, they will all be combined.
