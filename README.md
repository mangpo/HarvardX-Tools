HarvardX-Tools
==============
This is a public repository for the tools being used by the HarvardX research team to package, analyse, and manipulate
the data that is generated by Harvard courses on the edX platform. 

1) Separate log file into different log files for different courses:

python src/main/python/logs/separateClassLogs.py name_of_institute

name_of_institute has to match with with the name in the URL path. For example, name_of_institute = BerkeleyX

2) On each course's log file, generate nicely formatted CSV file for data analysis by running:

python src/main/python/makePersonClick.py course_log course_axis output_file.csv
