# each course, in the course directory, and a Log directory as a sibling of the course
# directories that will contain the raw files.
# The script takes two parameters-- the first is the day from which the log entries are
# to be processed (the first day of the week) in YYYY-[MM-DD format, while the second is 
# the identifier of the week, in YYYY-MM-DD format, generally the timestamp of the log
# file dump produced by edX (and which tends to be the last day the log files were collected
# in this dump.

#first, we get rid of any files that have already been processed, passing in the first date of
#a log that we want to keep as the command to the scripts
